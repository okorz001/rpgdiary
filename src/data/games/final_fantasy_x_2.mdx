After completing Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X, I had to decide whether to play its sequel or skip ahead to the next main
game. Ultimately, I chose to play this because it was released chronologically between X and XII, so it felt
historically relevant. Oddly, I cannot remember if I have actually played this game before or if I've only read
about it. It's a very controversial game among fans of the series, so I was curious how I'd feel about it.

In many ways, Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X-2 is a polar opposite of Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X. Unfortunately, since I enjoy
almost everything about Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X, that means I really did not enjoy this one at all. Honestly, I wanted
to quit pretty much immediately, and that feeling lingered the whole playthrough.

The most obvious and glaring thing that hits you as soon as you start the game is the massive change in tone.
Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X is a very serious game, but Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X-2 is lighthearted and campy. I found
this a little frustrating as some returning characters felt reduced to gags and some of the changes seemed nonsensical.
<Spoiler>Yuna cannot be a summoner anymore, so now she's a dual pistol wielding pop singer in hot pants? Cid turned
Zanarkand into a tourist trap? And _what_ is the deal with Brother?</Spoiler> I was fine with the new characters being
campy however.

I really do not like the plot in this game at all. The <Spoiler>doppelganger / mistaken identity</Spoiler> plot device
feels lazy and uninteresting. The concept of <Spoiler>Vegnagun</Spoiler> is somewhat interesting, but I don't really
understand how <Spoiler>it and everyone else travels to the Farplane.</Spoiler> Worst of all, I actually hate the "good"
ending more than the "bad" ending! <Spoiler>The "good" ending somehow handwaves Tidus back into existence and that
really undermines Yuna's character develpoment. On the contrary, the "bad" ending has Yuna finally move on and accept
Tidus's disappearance, which seems much more fitting.</Spoiler>

Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X-2 brings back the job system which is a favorite mechanic of mine. However, this particular
iteration felt very flat to me. You generally cannot mix jobs together this time &mdash; instead, you can change between
jobs mid-battle to access the abilities you need. This game also brings back ATB battles. Unfortunately, it also brings
back charge times which I think is an absolutely awful mechanic. The basic Attack is instantaneous, but powerful
abilities and spells have a delay before executing. All these factors led me to spend most of the game parked in high
strength jobs repeatedly selecting Attack which was quite dull. I couldn't even be bothered to use Armor&nbsp;Break
most of the time due to its lengthy delay!

Finally, this game is absolute hell if you are a completionist! There's a progress meter on your save, so naturally I
wanted to get 100%. However, this is truly tedious as it requires very careful planning to avoid missing some very minor
scenes. In addition to that, there are a lot of mini-games and tasks to do, most of which I found either boring or just
not fun. The main in-game reward for doing all of this is the previously mentioned "good" ending, which I actually hate
anyway! (Apparently, you only needed 75% for that, while the full 100% just adds an extra bonus scene.) I regret the
time spent grinding that junk, and I almost feel punished for it. (I actually gave up at 99% &mdash; the last few things
were just too tedious.)

In the end, I think I set myself up to really hate this game. I can't help but compare it to Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;X,
and it really fails to deliver anything like that game. I also tried to 100% it, which forced me to meticulously follow
a checklist, sucking most of the fun out of the game. If I ever play this again (New Game+?), I would definitely ignore
most of the side quests. I'm not sure I could ever truly separate the game from its predecessor though.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. There's no doubt that this was the least fun that I've had playing
anything in a long time. (Sorry.)
