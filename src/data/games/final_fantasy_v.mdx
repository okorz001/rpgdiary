Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;V is a game I've already completed multiple times, on multiple platforms. How does it hold up on
replay?

Before I continue, I must clarify that this version was never officially released in the US. I used the
[RPGe&nbsp;(v1.1) translation hack](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/353/). It's possible that this translation
may have mistakes.

The defining feature of this game is its job system. In addition to standard character levels, characters also gain
experience towards the current job they have equipped, unlocking new abilities. Characters can equip abilities they have
learned from other jobs which allows for some interesting combinations. I really enjoy this feature because leveling
the jobs feels a lot less tedious than typical character leveling. I never explicitly grinded, but there were many times
that I did a few extra battles because I was close to another job level. I also liked that there were no extra party
members to rotate through and keep leveled.

Personally, I like the story of this game, although it can be a little campy at times. I think it's the best version of
the original Final&nbsp;Fantasy trope about fire, water, wind, and earth crystals. <Spoiler>Exdeath is a little
cartoony, but he's a good villain. Gilgamesh is goofy but in an endearing way.</Spoiler> Both of these characters also
have awesome themes, and Battle&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Big&nbsp;Bridge in particular is one of my favorite songs from any
video game.

This is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, so it's hard for me to find complaints. I suppose the soundtrack as a whole
is less memorable than other games in the series, but it still has some really good songs.

Obviously, I enjoyed this game. I think it's frequently overlooked and deserves more attention!

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. This is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, so it's going right to the
top!
