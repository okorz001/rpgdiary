Although I am a big fan of Final Fantasy, I was very skeptical of Final Fantasy&nbsp;XIII-2 &mdash; I didn't like
<GameLink slug="final_fantasy_xiii" /> and I _really_ did not like <GameLink slug="final_fantasy_x_2">the only other
direct sequel</GameLink> in the series. Did this game exceed my expectations?

<GameHeader />

Despite the abrupt and confusing introduction, I enjoyed the plot in this game. Caius is a solid antagonist which is
something that I thought the previous game was missing. The main story is a little short, but I really enjoyed the
ending. There is also a fair amount of side content that helps round out the world. My biggest complaint is that some
previous characters, <Spoiler>Sazh and Snow</Spoiler>, are largely written out of the game without a satisfying
explanantion. Also some of the finer lore details are again hidden in the datalog, which I think is a poor design
choice.

Overall, the game changes most of the things I disliked about the previous game. As explained above, the plot, side
quests and game world are much improved. Game overs were _much_ less frequent in this game since _both_ Serah and Noel
need to be KO-ed this time (you can switch between them). Party members are still controlled by AI, but the faster-paced
battles made poor AI choices less impactful.

Most monsters have a chance to join the party after they are defeated. There are only two characters this time, so the
third party slot is reserved for monsters. Monster catching adds a collectible aspect to the game which makes it more
fun to slow down and explore areas. Unfortunately, raising monsters seemed to be very expensive (in either gil or time)
since it depends on consumable items instead of experience points. By the end of the game my monster was essentially
deadweight as Serah and Noel had significantly higher stats.

I was frustrated by some of the mini-games. There are recurring "anomaly" puzzles that need to be solved to advance the
game. The "connect the dots" type becomes unnecessarily difficult as the camera moves back and forth, making it harder
to see where to go. The "clock" type can be randomized and can also have a time limit. As the puzzles got larger and
larger, it became too difficult for me to solve without just brute-forcing it until I stumbled into a solution.
Finally, there's a side quest to just grind out 7,777 coins from a slot machine &mdash; I gave up after an hour.

Final Fantasy&nbsp;XIII-2 was the first game in the series with DLC. Unfortunately, I think most of the DLC is pretty
low quality: useless cosmetics, some equipment (thankfully not gamebreaking), and some bonus fan-service boss battles.
Lightning's DLC does round out the story a bit, but I found the actual gameplay boring &mdash; I ended up watching the
cutscenes online instead.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. I was pleasantly surprised by this one, and I was a little sad that the
game ended so quickly. It's not a top tier Final Fantasy, but I think I enjoyed it more than
<GameLink slug="final_fantasy_iv" />.
