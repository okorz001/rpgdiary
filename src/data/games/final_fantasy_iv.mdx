Final Fantasy&nbsp;IV is a very popular game, but I've never completed it. I started to play it once a long time ago,
but for some reason I abandoned it before getting very far. Now that I'm playing through the entire series, it's time
for me to finally play this one all the way through.

<GameHeader />

Final Fantasy&nbsp;IV is a simple game. Party changes are forced at certain points in the story and, as far as I can
tell, characters have fixed stat growth and learn abilities at fixed levels. When I was younger, I would have found this
boring, but as an adult I find it relaxing to just play the game without worrying about that. "Freedom from choice", if
you will.

The story is undoubtedly the highlight of the game. This is the first game that really feels like a proper "Final
Fantasy". The party has many memorable characters with their own backstories. <Spoiler>I was saddened by the many
apparent sacrifices made by various party members during the game. Although, I was actually disappointed when most
of them were suddenly revealed to still alive at the end because I felt it kind of lowered the stakes.</Spoiler> Despite
the short length of the game, the plot still has quite a few twists and I was pleasantly surprised while playing.
<Spoiler>Well, except for that repeated mind control twist which I found rather silly (fool me once...).</Spoiler>

I guess my biggest problem with this game is the ATB (Active Time Battle) implementation. While the series would become
well-known for this mechanic, this is the first game to use it and it shows. There's no visible ATB bar yet, so it's
unclear which characters will act next and when. Worse, spells have a casting delay which makes powerful but slow spells
somewhat impratical to use. However, this is really scraping the bottom of the barrel for complaints.

Ultimately, I think Final Fantasy&nbsp;IV makes for a great "beginner's RPG" &mdash; it has an memorable cast of
characters, but it is short in length and has simple mechanics. While there is little replay value here, I've heard
that this translation is poor (despite being done in-house by Square), so I may eventually play one of the many
ports/remakes.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. It's a tough decision for me between this game and
<GameLink slug="final_fantasy_iii" />, but I'll choose plot over gameplay and put this game on top!
