# The Site

In summer 2022, I had a goal to play every mainline Final Fantasy game. I had already played some of them before, but it
had been so long that I decided to just play all of them in order. About a month into this plan, I decided to write
down my thoughts about the games I was playing. It is not my goal to explicitly review the games &mdash; I just want to
remember which games I enjoyed and which I did not.

Though my initial plan was just to play the Final Fantasy series, I decided to expand the site to RPGs in general.
While (re-)playing the Final Fantasy games, I was reminded of many other RPGs I would like to eventually play (again).
I chose to limit the site to just RPGs because they are similar enough to compare and contrast with each other. It's
harder to compare things like Halo to Pokemon to Monster Hunter.

# The Author

Some of my fondest memories from my childhood are playing RPGs like <GameLink slug="final_fantasy_vi" /> and
<GameLink slug="chrono_trigger" />. I remember spending entire weekends playing games and even waking up early before
school to sneak some time in. Now that I've got a full-time job and kids, it's much harder to find time to play...

RPGs have always been my favorite genre of video games. I was particularly interested in the plot heavy games because
it felt more exciting than just reading a book &mdash; there was pictures and music too! (Now most RPGs have talking
too, so the comparison to reading a book is dated.) I also liked the turn-based combat because I am generally terrible
at action games. As modern RPGs focus more and more on flashy graphics and realtime combat, I have lost some interest
in the genre. For me, the 90s was the golden era for RPGs with numerous classics on the SNES and PlayStation.
