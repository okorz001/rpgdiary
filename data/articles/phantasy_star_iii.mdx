While <GameLink slug="phantasy_star_ii" /> was technically a 16-bit game, it still felt like an 8-bit game to me &mdash;
it was tedious and grindy. Will Phantasy Star&nbsp;III be more of the same, or will it evoke my nostalgia for 16-bit
RPGs?

As a 1990 game, it's unsurprising that Phantasy Star&nbsp;III still feels more like an 8-bit game &mdash; it was
contemporary with <GameLink slug="final_fantasy_iii" /> and <GameLink slug="dragon_quest_iv" />. Still, the branching
story with actually impactful choices is pretty impressive for its time. The story exceeded my (low) expectations,
though it still has a weak and terse presentation (perhaps limited by the era).

Unfortunately, my strongest memory of this game will probably be the endless backtracking across the various maps. The
game is quite frankly an endurance test as the plot will force you to travel literally corner to corner, often through
the same tunnels and caves over and over again. While there are finally "vehicles" in the final act, they have various
limitations that prevent them from improving the travel situation. Inexcusably, the escape and teleport spells from the
previous game have also been removed, so I had to backtrack out of several dungeons as well. (Yes, there _is_ a
consumable for the escape spell, but I always forgot to buy them!)

Thankfully, Phantasy Star&nbsp;III is not as hard as the previous game, and I spent far less time on dedicated grinding.
However, combat is also far less interesting, as spells are essentially useless this time around &mdash; every
character should just attack, unless they need to heal. I guess this is both good and bad, as it made it easier to just
zone out during the long boring hikes to previous locations.

I usually don't comment on soundtracks. While some RPGs _do_ have a wonderful soundtrack, it never raises my opinion of
the game &mdash; it's just a bonus. However, I found the Phantasy Star&nbsp;III soundtrack so annoying that it was
actually detrimental to my experience.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. I'll put this ahead of the similarly backtracking-heavy
<GameLink slug="dragon_quest_vii" />, because Phantasy Star&nbsp;III is magnitudes shorter in length. I think I had more
fun playing <GameLink slug="final_fantasy" /> though.
