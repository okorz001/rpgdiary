Lightning Returns is the third and final game in the Final Fantasy&nbsp;XIII series. While I did not enjoy
<GameLink slug="final_fantasy_xiii" />, I was pleasantly surprised by <GameLink slug="final_fantasy_xiii_2" />, so I was
cautiously looking forward to this game. I bought it on release, but I abandoned my initial playthrough about halfway.
I don't remember much about the game, but it's time to finally play it start to finish.

Lightning Returns is very different from the previous games. After a brief prologue, the game becomes non-linear: there
are five quests in four areas which can be completed in any order. There is not much information or guidance given
upfront, so you must explore the world to figure out what to do. Additionally, the majority of the game occurs under a
doomsday clock &mdash; the main quests must be completed before the clock runs out. The clock gave me a lot of anxiety
as I was constantly afraid of running out of time. Ironically, the clock is actually quite generous (on easy mode at
least). I had so much time to spare that I literally slept through the last few days at the inn to get to the ending.

The plot is a mess, although it is not surprising given how the previous game ended. Still, the God and his savior story
felt like it came from out of nowhere with little explanation and I did not care for it. After the prologue, the game
felt very dull and boring to me. Most of the game is focused around "saving souls" which is just a polite way to say
"banal fetch quests for generic NPCs". While many RPGs could be described this way, the difference is that instead of
cutscenes advancing a main story, there is just a bunch of filler dialogue with NPCs about their personal lives. To be
fair, there _are_ a few scenes fleshing out the main story, but they seemed to be gated by the doomsday clock instead of
quest progress, so I didn't see some of them until I was almost finished with the game. The ending chapter has the most
developed and interesting story, but it takes 30+ hours of gameplay to get there.

Every major character from the previous games makes an appearance in this game. While I thought Snow and Noel were
written well, the rest were a mixed bag. <Spoiler>Hope is inexplicably a child again. Sazh has become somewhat of a joke
now as he is _yet again_ separated from Dajh. Caius is somehow still alive. Strangest of all, the legion of Yuels is
revealed to be the Great Chaos that destroyed the world.</Spoiler> The ending also made little sense to me as it felt
like a lot of handwaving to resolve everyone's issues.

I generally enjoyed the battles in this game as they felt fast-paced. Lightning has three schemata slots (equipment and
abilities) and you can switch freely between these during battle. Each schemata has its own ATB bar, but the active
schemata's ATB bar does not charge. This means many battles require frequent switches. There are bonuses for timing
attacks and guards well which makes battles more engaging. I tended to overcommit to attacking though, so I was terrible
at guarding.

I was disappointed with the soundtrack this time. I thought many of the new songs are bland and forgettable, especially
compared to the soundtracks of the previous games. Several memorable songs from those games are reused again here, which
I think exacerbates the issue.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. I did not enjoy this game, but I did not hate it as much as
