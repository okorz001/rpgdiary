Now that I've completed the mainline Phantasy Star series, I'm ready to play another classic RPG series. I still want to
look outside the giant shadow of Square, so I've decided to go with Breath of Fire. Ironically, the first game was
published in the US by Square (and even marketed as "from the makers of the Final Fantasy series"), but the game was
actually developed by Capcom. Unlike the previous series I've played, Breath of Fire starts in the 16-bit era,
so I've got higher expectations.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. TODO
