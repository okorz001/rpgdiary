Final Fantasy&nbsp;V is a game I've already completed multiple times, on multiple platforms. How does it hold up on
replay?

The defining feature of this game is its job system. In addition to standard character levels, characters also gain
experience towards the current job they have equipped, unlocking new abilities. Characters can equip abilities they have
learned from other jobs which allows for some interesting combinations. I really enjoy this feature because leveling
the jobs feels a lot less tedious than typical character leveling. I never explicitly grinded, but there were many times
that I did a few extra battles because I was close to another job level. I also liked that there were no extra party
members to rotate through and keep leveled.

Personally, I like the story of this game, although it can be a little campy at times. I think it's the best version of
the original Final Fantasy trope about fire, water, wind, and earth crystals. <Spoiler>Sure, Exdeath is a little
cartoony, but he's a good antagonist. Gilgamesh is goofy but in an endearing way.</Spoiler> Both of these characters
also have awesome themes, and Battl on the Big Bridge in particular is one of my favorite themes from any video game.

This is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, so it's hard for me to find complaints. I suppose the soundtrack as a whole
is less memorable than other games in the series, but it still has some really good songs.

Obviously, I enjoyed this game. I think it's frequently overlooked and deserves more attention!

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. This is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, so it's going right to the
top!
