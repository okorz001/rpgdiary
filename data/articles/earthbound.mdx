The Mother series is famous for its humor and novelty, but I did not enjoy the first game due to its age. I am hopeful
that I will enjoy the second game more, if for no other reason than it's not an 8-bit game! I _think_ that I may have
already played this game once 20+ years ago, but I do not remember anything about it.

<Note>I'm breaking my convention here by using the US name over the JP name, but it is much more well-known as
EarthBound than Mother 2, as EarthBound was the only Mother game released in the US (excluding
<GameLink slug="mother">Mother</GameLink>'s NSO release 25 years later).</Note>

The pacing and balance of EarthBound is significantly improved compared to the previous game. While I frequently needed
to grind to survive the many random battles in Mother, I don't believe I did any dedicated grinding at all during my
EarthBound. EarthBound is also much more forgiving as there are many opportunities to recover PP, which is essentially
free healing. Finally, the random encounters are replaced by enemies on the map, similar to
<GameLink slug="chrono_trigger" />. While I found many of these encounters difficult to avoid, there seemed to be much
less battles overall.

The story and presentation is very similar to Mother, but with upgraded 16-bit graphics. Again, the story follows the
<GameLink slug="dragon_quest_ii" /> template of a long adventure to assemble the party, gather multiple MacGuffins, and
solve whatever unrelated local problems you discover along the way.  The main appeal of the game, once again, is the
goofy humor and whimiscal tone. The adventure is filled with numerous bizarre events and items, and this really stands
out from other RPGs.

However, if you are looking for an epic story against a memorable villain, then you will be disappointed. After the
opening sequence, the antagonist is hardly ever mentioned again and is never seen until the final battle. Unfortunately,
I personally much prefer an epic story over an adventure, so I was bored with EarthBound's story. The story really felt
dated and minimal in comparison to games like <GameLink slug="phantasy_star_iv" /> and
<GameLink slug="final_fantasy_vi" />, both of which were released before EarthBound. Perhaps it's a translation issue,
but I actually found the story and antagonist of the previous game more interesting than this one.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. EarthBound's story didn't really interest me, but the gameplay was
smooth and painless, albeit fairly standard. I was more interested with the stories of both SNES Dragon Quests, but I
enjoyed the lack of grinding over <GameLink slug="dragon_quest_iii" />.
