The Mother series has a huge cult following, but I did not enjoy the first two games that much. Both games featured more
of an episodic adventure rather than an epic story that I personally prefer. However, I've seen many people list
Mother&nbsp;3 as the best game in the series, with emphasis on its story in particular. Mother&nbsp;3 is generally
unknown in the US since it was not officially released here, so I'm going into this game blind.

After completing a game, I add it to [my overall enjoyment ranking](/ranking) which orders the games I've completed from
those I most enjoyed to those I least enjoyed. TODO
